# flask-react-skeleton

This started off as an attempt to make an image gallery based off a photo booth app that was placing the output photos in a folder on my Dropbox account. I ended up scrapping the idea (using Dropbox's app gave me most of what I wanted without having to write my own code), but the template I made is still pretty useful for my own future usage, so here we are.

Flask for the API, React for the front-end, `npm start` runs both the Python server and a live-reloading server for the React front-end.

This is a sister project to [jc4p/flask-gauth-skeleton](https://github.com/jc4p/flask-gauth-skeleton).
